# NeuralNeuron
Denosing and Super Resolution of Medical Images and Detection of Tumor
This project focuses on using advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to enhance low-resolution (LR) images into high-resolution (HR) ones. The developed system leverages state-of-the-art methodologies to reconstruct fine details, textures, and overall image clarity. The project demonstrates the feasibility and scalability of super-resolution in various domains, including medical imaging, satellite imagery, and digital media.
Key Features:
High-quality image reconstruction using CNN-based architecture.
Robust model capable of enhancing textures and fine details.
Support for various applications, such as medical diagnostics, surveillance, and geospatial analysis.
Preprocessing techniques like normalization, data augmentation, and synthetic noise handling.
Evaluation metrics: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

Usage:
Training the Model:
Run the CNN_algorithm.ipynb notebook to train the super-resolution model using paired LR-HR datasets.

Denoising:
Use the denoising.ipynb notebook to preprocess images and remove artifacts or noise before applying super-resolution.

Object Detection (Optional):
If combined with detection tasks, refer to Detection.ipynb for integrating object detection with enhanced image resolution.

Testing:
Test the trained model on unseen LR images and visualize results using the provided testing script or notebooks.
