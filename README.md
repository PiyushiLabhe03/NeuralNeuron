samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.




## Project Overview:
This project focuses on enhancing low-resolution images into high-resolution versions using advanced deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The system aims to reconstruct finer details, textures, and clarity in images. This project demonstrates scalable solutions applicable to medical imaging, satellite data analysis, and digital content creation.


## Key Features:
- High-quality image reconstruction using CNN-based architecture.
- Robust model capable of enhancing textures and fine details.
- Applicable across various domains, including medical diagnostics, surveillance, and geospatial analysis.
- Preprocessing techniques like normalization, data augmentation, and synthetic noise handling.
- Evaluation metrics include PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

## Installation Instructions:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PiyushiLabhe03/NeuralNeuron.git
   cd NeuralNeuron
  
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the dataset (e.g., DIV2K) and place it in the `data/` directory.
4. (Optional) Install GPU-accelerated libraries like TensorFlow-GPU for faster training.


## Usage:
1. **Training the Model:**
   Use the `CNN_algorithm.ipynb` notebook to train the super-resolution model on paired LR-HR datasets.

2. **Denoising:**
   Run the `denoising.ipynb` notebook to preprocess images and remove artifacts or noise before applying super-resolution.

3. **Object Detection (Optional):**
   Use the `Detection.ipynb` notebook to integrate object detection with enhanced image resolution.

4. **Testing:**
   Test the trained model on unseen LR images and visualize results using the provided testing scripts or notebooks.


## Evaluation Metrics:
- **PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio):** Evaluates the quality of reconstructed images.
- **SSIM (Structural Similarity Index):** Measures perceptual similarity between HR ground truth and generated outputs.


## Applications:
- **Medical Imaging:** Enhanced diagnostic precision with sharper MRI/CT scans.
- **Satellite and Geospatial Analysis:** Improved urban planning and disaster response through clearer imagery.
- **Security and Surveillance:** Better identification from video or photo feeds.
- **Content Creation:** Enhanced visuals for media and entertainment industries.


## Future Scope:
- **Real-Time Super-Resolution:**
  Optimizing the model for video and live-streaming applications.

- **Noise and Artifact Reduction:**
  Refining image quality by minimizing noise and compression artifacts.

- **Enhanced Accessibility:**
  Developing user-friendly interfaces for broader access to non-technical audiences.
